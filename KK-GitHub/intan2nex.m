%
% usage: nexData = intan2nex(dig_in,analog_in,intan_info,varargin)
%
% function to read in timestamps from intan digital and analog in lines and
% convert to a .nex file with events for the choice task
%
% INPUTS:
%   dig_in - name of digital input file recorded with the intan system.
%       These are generally digital lines from the NI boards running the
%       choice task.
%   analog_in - name of analog input file recorded with the intan system.
%       These are generally digital lines from the NI boards running the
%       choice task, plugged into analog lines if we run out of digital 
%       lines. Note that as of 3/26/2020, the line names are hard-coded in
%       the dig_linenames = ... and analog_linenames = ... lines below.
%   intan_info - data structure containing info read in from the rhd file
%       .XXX - 
%   TO ADD HERE: DESCRIPTION OF THE INFORMATION IN THE INTAN_INFO FILE,
%   WHICH I THINK IS WHAT'S READ IN FROM THE .RHD FILE
%
% VARARGS:
%   'writefile' - whether or not to write the nex formatted data to a new
%       file; default filename is the original filename with .nex appended
%       - that is, should be "XXXX.box.nex" where XXXX is the original base
%       filename. NOT SURE IF WE STILL NEED THIS
%
% OUTPUTS:
%   nexData - nex data structure

%
%   nexData.events - array of event structures
%           event.name - name of neuron variable

    % Sometimes all the lines are low at the same time

    % NOTE: this doesn't explicitly detect "pops", where 
    % the lines go low then high again, but instead
    % just detects whether all lines are low. Should be fine, I _think_...
    % above is from AW.

    % this needs to be changed because it's not always true that
    % ALL lines "pop" simultaneously. Rewrite the algorithm to
    % detect transitions to "low" and then immediately back to
    % "high". This happens one SOME but not all lines every time a
    % digital port read is initiated in LV. Fucking annoying. There
    % may be a way to fix this with a clever combination of
    % resistors, but I think this software work-around will be OK.
